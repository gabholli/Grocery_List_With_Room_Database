# Project Title
Grocery List Android App

## Description
This application involves using Java to create a grocery list app to use on an Android phone. A room database, implemented 
to allow for data persistence, gives the program the ability to preserve the list created even after the app closes.

The app limits itself to one screen with one list and one text field for adding items. Swiping to the right off-screen removes
an item.

## Getting Started
### Executing program
- To allow for use, the program downloads onto an Android phone directly from the computer containing the files. The app doesn't
have a presence on any store due to its basic funcionality.
